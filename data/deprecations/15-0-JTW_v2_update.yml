# This is a template for a feature deprecation
# A deprecation typically occurs when a feature or capability is planned to be removed in a future release.
# Deprecations should be announced at least two releases prior to removal.  Any breaking changes should only be done in major releases.
#
# Below is an example of what a single entry should look like, it's required attributes,
# and what types we expect those attribute values to be.
#
# For more information please refer to the handbook documentation here:
# https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/#deprecations
#
# Please delete this line and above before submitting your merge request.

- name: "Changes to the `CI_JOB_JWT`"  # The name of the feature to be deprecated
  announcement_milestone: "14.8"  # The milestone when this feature was first announced as deprecated.
  announcement_date: "2022-02-22"  # The date of the milestone release when this feature was first announced as deprecated. This should almost always be the 22nd of a month (YYYY-MM-22), unless you did an out of band blog post.
  removal_milestone: "15.0"  # The milestone when this feature is planned to be removed
  removal_date: "2022-05-22"  # The date of the milestone release when this feature is planned to be removed. This should almost always be the 22nd of a month (YYYY-MM-22), unless you did an out of band blog post.
  breaking_change: true  # If this deprecation is a breaking change, set this value to true

    The `CI_JOB_JWT` will be updated to support a wider variety of cloud providers. It will be changed to match [`CI_JOB_JWT_V2`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html), but this change may not be backwards compatible for all users, including Hashicorp Vault users. To maintain the current behavior, users can switch to using `CI_JOB_JWT_V1`, or update their configuration in GitLab 15.0 to use the improved `CI_JOB_JWT`.
