    The predefined CI/CD variables that start with `CI_BUILD_*` were deprecated in GitLab 9.0, and will be removed in GitLab 15.0. If you still use these variables, be sure to change to the current [`CI_JOB_*` predefined variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html) which are identical (except for the updated name).
