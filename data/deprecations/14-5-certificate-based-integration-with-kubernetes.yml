    [The certificate-based integration with Kubernetes will be deprecated and removed](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/15/deprecating-the-cert-based-kubernetes-integration/).

    If you are a self-managed customer, in GitLab 15.0, a feature flag will be introduced so you can keep
    certificate-based integration enabled. The flag will be disabled by default.
    The flag and the related code will be removed in GitLab 15.6.

    Until the final removal in 15.6, features built on the integration will continue to work, and
    GitLab will continue to fix security and critical issues.

    If you use GitLab.com, certificate-based integrations will cease functioning in 15.0.

    For a more robust, secure, forthcoming, and reliable integration with Kubernetes, we recommend you use the
    [agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/) to connect Kubernetes clusters with GitLab.
    See the documentation for [how to migrate](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/clusters/migrate_to_gitlab_agent.html).
